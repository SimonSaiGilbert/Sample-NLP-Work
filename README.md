# This repository serves as a demo for my work with Natural Language Processing

## Email Clustering

In this work I was given a large set of emails as my data, and I was tasked with the vague task of finding patterns in it. I process the data, run a K-means clustering algorithm, and analyze the results.

## Web Scraping

Here I was tasked with scraping data from Twitter, Wikipedia, ABC News, and FOX News. I scrape, process, and analyze the data. I also train various language models to generate tweets in the style of the scraped data.
